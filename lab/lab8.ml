Some examples from the Language
id+id+id
id+-id*id+id
id
-------------------------------------------id
Some examples NOT in the Language
id+(id*id)             no parens
id-id                  so subtraction
idid                   ids must be separated


Explain why this grammar is ambiguous:
id+id+id is one example sentence, parse trees were required for total credit

Rewrite the grammar so that â€“ has precedence over + and * . And * has precedence over +
A ::= <A> + <A> | <T>
T ::= <T> * <T> | <M>
M ::= -<M> | id

Rewrite the grammar so that it is unambiguous and + is right-associative and * is left-associative
A ::= <T> + <A> | <T>
T ::= <T> * <M> | <M>
M ::= -<M> | id
this would also be a correct answer for the above prob
